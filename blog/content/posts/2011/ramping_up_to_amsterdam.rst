Last month another CodeJam was held to work on the 1.1 branch of Holland and we
are happy to report that it was a fairly good success. Most of the main plugins
have been ported over to the new API. The API itself has been retooled to make
things a bit more pluggable. Of note was the changes made to the compression
mechanisms paving the way for additional stream plugins (including encryption).
Testing has also been greatly improved in the 1.1 branch.

Wanna check it out? Head over to the
`Amsterdam <https://github.com/holland-backup/holland/tree/amsterdam>`_ branch
