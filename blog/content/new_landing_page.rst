As you may have noticed, we have switched our landing page over to a blog based
format. Previously, we simply used our wiki as our main page. We realized, 
however, that while the `wiki <http://wiki.hollandbackup.org>`_ is wonderful, it is not best suited for 
announcements, updates, and general distribution of news about the Holland
Backup project. So here we are! Expect more frequent updates about the Holland
Backup project to be found here in the near future.
